Send to Prowl
=============
_Send to Prowl_ is a [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) extension which sends the link of your Current tab to [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com/) on your iPhone or iPad. You can then configure Prowl to open the link in Safari or another browser, and continue browsing the page on your iDevice.

Installation
============
For now, you'll have to clone the repository and use _Load unpacked extensionâ€¦_ option under the _Developer mode_ options in the extensions tab.

The browser action icon, `56-cloud.png`, is part of the [Glyphish Free](http://glyphish.com/) icon set, and has been resized to a square image. The icon shown in the extensions list is an adaptation of the original [Prowl app](http://www.prowlapp.com) icon.
